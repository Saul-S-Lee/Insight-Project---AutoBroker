# Insight-Project---AutoBroker
Data analysis and prediction model related to my Insight Project - AutoBroker

Thank you for your interest.

This directory contains the files with the analysis for predicting the total claims amount from an insurance dataset "train.csv". The resulting regularized linear regression model is used to build the final prediction model for my Insight Data Science project called AutoBroker (http://autobroker.site). 

The full model contains proprietary information from my project consulting partner so it is not shared publicly. 

Please feel free to contact me for more information.
